## Intro

This repository demonstrates customer messaging implementation with [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). We use [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) as the customer messaging platform in this example.

## Deploy

You can deploy VRS to our scalable serverless infrastructure free of cost.  
Thanks to the on-demand pricing model, you don’t pay a cent for infrastructure during idle time.

Once you have [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) or [Now Desktop](https://zeit.co/download) installed, clone this repo, specify the necessary secrets with Now CLI, and run `now` — that’s it. The [deployment section](https://zeit.co/blog/serverless-ecommerce#deploying-and-infrastructure) on our blog post explains how you can specify the secrets.

## About

Our mission at ZEIT is to make the cloud accessible to everyone. We do that by creating products that improve developer experience, provisioning infrastructure that is globally available, and by teaching the developer community about serverless-related technology. We made VRS to showcase that it’s possible to create a fully functional, high-performance e-commerce store without requiring infrastructure know-how.
